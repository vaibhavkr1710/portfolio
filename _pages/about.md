Hi, I'm _Vaibhav_. I'm 24 years old, originally from an overlooked corner of the map, and a Computer Science Engineering student with a deep curiosity for how things work—and how to make them better. I’ve broken pipelines, secured them, analyzed vulnerabilities, and occasionally built things that actually worked. After some trial, error, and SonarQube warnings, I’ve come to one conclusion: _technology is always evolving—and so am I_.

<br />

Luckily, iteration is the point—and I’m here to iterate better every day.

<br />

I’m focused on building secure, scalable systems while learning to test, break, and harden them again. My experience spans several areas, and I’ve developed a balanced mindset between curiosity, discipline, and the occasional Stack Overflow deep-dive. Some of the things I’ve done include:

- **DevSecOps & Security Tools** – Hands-on with tools like **Maven**, **SonarQube**, and **Snyk**, working on identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities in CI/CD workflows.
- **Software Testing & QA** – Currently training in test automation, software quality assurance, and cloud infrastructure fundamentals.
- **Cloud & DevOps Learning Path** – Exploring **AWS**, containerization, CI/CD pipelines, and secure deployment practices to build a future-proof skillset.

<br />

You’ll learn more about me as you explore this site—bugs and all.
